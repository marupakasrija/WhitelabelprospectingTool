**GrowMeOrganic — White-label Prospecting Tool Dashboard**

---

## 🚀 Objective  
Assist in planning and evaluating the creation of a **white-label platform** for GrowMeOrganic's **prospecting tool**.

## 🧠 Important Jargons  

- **White-label**: A product/service made by one company and rebranded by another to appear as their own.
- **Prospecting Tool**: A software application that helps businesses find potential customers (emails, phone numbers) using search filters like job title, industry, location, etc.

## 📌 Context  

GrowMeOrganic wants to **expand its product offerings** by introducing a **white-label version** of its current standalone prospecting tool. This version will enable other businesses to **rebrand and sell** the tool under their own name, while GrowMeOrganic continues managing the backend infrastructure.

The white-label dashboard will empower our customers to:

- Customize branding (logos, color schemes)
- Set and manage pricing and billing
- Create multiple subscription plans
- Access analytics for performance tracking

## 🎯 Our Goal  

Develop a **dashboard** that allows customers to easily build and manage their own white-labeled prospecting tool instance, including:

- Branding customization
- Billing management
- Plan creation
- Revenue analytics

GrowMeOrganic will handle all backend and technical operations.

1. Sign up / Login
